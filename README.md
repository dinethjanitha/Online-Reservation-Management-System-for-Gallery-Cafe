# Online Reservation Management System for Gallery Cafe

<p>"The Gallery Café" has launched a new interactive, database-driven website to enhance customer experience and streamline operations. As the newly appointed web development officer, my task is to design and develop this site, incorporating features inspired by popular cafés like Cinnamon Lakeside, Café Mocha by Barista, and Starbucks. The website will include pre-ordering, user account management, detailed meal information, reservations, and specials.
The project involves creating a responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, combined with a robust back-end using MySQL and PHP for user authentication, CRUD operations, search functionalities, and administrative features. Comprehensive testing, including unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing (UAT), will ensure the application's functionality and reliability. This thorough approach aims to deliver a user-friendly and efficient web application that meets the café's operational needs and enhances the user experience.
